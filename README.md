# PixelBrailleGenerator
## WPF Application to generate ASCII Art from an Image using Braille Characters
> Made for fun in about 2.5 hours, half of that was spent trying to get a proper monospace font to work in wpf (it did not end up working so the preview isnt perfect).

Click on the left square to load an image and on the right to copy the generated text.
